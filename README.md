## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned a bit of animation, making the social media popup. Also scaling the images.

### Continued development

The positioning of the mobile share popup was really difficult and I'm not sure the way I did it is the best way.
